            Molten chocolate cake is a dessert that consists of a chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate core. It is named for that molten center, and it is also known as chocolate coulant, chocolate lava cake, or simply lava cake. It should not be confused with chocolate fondant, a recipe that contains little flour, but much chocolate and butter, hence melting on the palate.
